# SCRUM LOG
## March 2022


***SCRUM Notes 3/3/2022***
- Researching the modern configuration for integrating a ASP.NET Core web application with a Vue.js front-end. Will have a more conrcete idea after our 1pm meeting today.
- After gather some more details regarding what will be required in the user dashboard for NMJL, I can generate a design prototype.
- My goals is that I can demo the Figma prototype to the team tomorrow, and once I get feedback on the design, I can code it up over the weekend.


***SCRUM Notes 3/4/2022***
1. Demo the Figma prototype for the NMJL User Dashboard.
2. Since Bill mentioned in yesterday's meeting, that we could consider new tools to use to develop NMJL, I have 2 new options to show the team:
   1. New `Vite` integration for the client side.
   2. The `csharp-vscode-setup.md` file if anyone on the team would prefer a VS Code code editor...however the consesus on in the dev community is the Visual Studio provides a much more rebust testing, debugging, and C# scoped development tools.
   3. I came across a extremely popular software project management provider call `Liner` --> `https://linear.app/`, which could be considered as a replacement for Jira.
