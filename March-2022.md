***SCRUM Notes 3/3/2022***
- Spent most of yesterday trying to debug my intv PR to make is mergeable, but started researching and designing afterwards. 
- Researching the modern configuration for integrating a ASP.NET Core web application with a Vue.js front-end. Will have a more conrete idea after our 1pm meeting today.
- After gather some more details regarding what will be required in the user dashboard for NMJL, I can generate a Figma prototype.
- My goals is that I can demo the Figma prototype to the team tomorrow, and once I get feedback on the design, I can code it up over the weekend.
